Intravenous
Adenocard
-LRB-
adenosine
-RRB-
has
been
effectively
administered
in
the
presence
of
other
cardioactive
drugs
,
such
as
quinidine
,
beta-adrenergic
blocking
agents
,
calcium
channel
blocking
agents
,
and
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
,
without
any
change
in
the
adverse
reaction
profile
.
Digoxin
and
verapamil
use
may
be
rarely
associated
with
ventricular
fibrillation
when
combined
with
Adenocard
.
Because
of
the
potential
for
additive
or
synergistic
depressant
effects
on
the
SA
and
AV
nodes
,
however
,
Adenocard
should
be
used
with
caution
in
the
presence
of
these
agents
.
The
use
of
Adenocard
in
patients
receiving
digitalis
may
be
rarely
associated
with
ventricular
fibrillation
.
The
effects
of
adenosine
are
antagonized
by
methylxanthines
such
as
caffeine
and
theophylline
.
In
the
presence
of
these
methylxanthines
,
larger
doses
of
adenosine
may
be
required
or
adenosine
may
not
be
effective
.
Adenosine
effects
are
potentiated
by
dipyridamole
.
Thus
,
smaller
doses
of
adenosine
may
be
effective
in
the
presence
of
dipyridamole
.
Carbamazepine
has
been
reported
to
increase
the
degree
of
heart
block
produced

other
agents
.
As
the
primary
effect
of
adenosine
is
to
decrease
conduction
through
the
A-V
node
,
higher
degrees
of

block
may
be
produced

there
exists
the
potential
for
serious

In
such
cases
of
combined
treatment
,
the
dose
of
one
or
both
agents
should
be
reduced

Cimetidine
reduces
the

Therefore
smaller

doses
will
be
required
with
prolonged
administration
and
the

my
be
extended
.
Perioperative
administration
of
drugs

Drug-Drug
Interactions
:
The
pharmacokinetic
and
pharmacodynamic
interactions
between
UROXATRAL
and
other
alpha-blockers
have
not
been
determined
.
However
,
interactions
may
be
expected
,
and
UROXATRAL
should
NOT
be
used
in
combination
with
other
alpha-blockers

Effects
of
Other
Drugs
on
Aliskiren
Based
on
in-vitro
studies
,
aliskiren
is
metabolized
by
CYP
3A4
.
Co-administration
of
lovastatin
,
atenolol
,
warfarin
,
furosemide
,
digoxin
,
celecoxib
,
hydrochlorothiazide
,
ramipril
,
valsartan
,
metformin
and
amlodipine
did
not
result
in
clinically
significant
increases
in
aliskiren
exposure
.
Co-administration
of
irbesartan
reduced
aliskiren
Cmax
up
to
50
%
after
multiple
dosing
.
Co-administration
of
atorvastatin
resulted
in
about
a
50
%
increase
in
aliskiren
Cmax
and
AUC
after
multiple
dosing
.
Ketoconazole
:
Co-administration
of
200
mg
twice-daily
ketoconazole
with
aliskiren
resulted
in
an
approximate
80
%
increase
in
plasma
levels
of
aliskiren
.
A
400
mg
once-daily
dose
was
not
studied
but
would
be
expected
to
increase
aliskiren
blood
levels
further
.
Effects
of
Aliskiren
on
Other
Drugs
Aliskiren
does
not
inhibit
the
CYP450
isoenzymes
-LRB-
CYP1A2
,
2C8
,
2C9
,
2C19
,
2D6
,
2E1
,
and
CYP
3A
-RRB-
or
induce
CYP
3A4
.
Co-administration
of
aliskiren
did
not
significantly
affect
the
pharmacokinetics
of
lovastatin
,
digoxin
,
valsartan
,
amlodipine
,
metformin
,
celecoxib
,
atenolol
,
atorvastatin
,
ramipril
or
hydrochlorothiazide
.
Warfarin
:
The
effects
of
aliskiren
on
warfarin
pharmacokinetics
have
not
been
evaluated
in
a
well-controlled
clinical
trial
.
Furosemide
:
When
aliskiren
was
co-administered
with
furosemide
,
the
AUC
and
Cmax
of
furosemide
were
reduced
by
about
30
%
and
50
%
,
respectively
.
Patients
who
are
applying
Panretin
gel
should
not
concurrently
use
products
that
contain
DEET
-LRB-
N
,
N-diethyl-m-toluamide
-RRB-
,
a
common
component
of
insect
repellent
products
.
Animal
toxicology
studies
showed
increased
DEET
toxicity
when
DEET
was
included
as
proof
of
the
formulation
.
Although
there
was
no
clinical
evidence
in
the
vehicle-controlled
studies
of
drug
interactions
with
systemic
antiretroviral
agents
,
including
protease
inhibitors
,
macrolide
antibiotics
,
and
azole
antifungals
,
the
effect
of
Panretin
gel
on
the
steady-state
concentrations
of
these
drugs
is
not
known
.
No
drug
interaction
data
are
available
on
concomitant
administration
of
Panretin
gel
and
systemic
anti-KS
agents
.
The
following
drug
interactions
were
observed
in
some
patients
undergoing
treatment
with
oral
allopurinol
.
Although
the
pattern
of
use
for
oral
allopurinol
includes
longer
term
therapy
,
particularly
for
gout
and
renal
calculi
,
the
experience
gained
may
be
relevant
.
Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine
:
Allopurinol
inhibits
the
enzymatic
oxidation
of
mercaptopurine
and
azathioprine
to
6-thiouric
acid
.
This
oxidation
,
which
is
catalyzed
by
xanthine
oxidase
,
inactivates
mercaptopurine
.
In
patients
receiving
mercaptopurine
-LRB-
Purinethol
-RRB-
or
azathioprine
-LRB-
Imuran
-RRB-
,
the
concomitant
administration
of
300-600
mg
of
allopurinol
per
day
will
require
a
reduction
in
dose
to
approximately
one-third
to
one-fourth
of
the
usual
dose
of
mercaptopurine
or
azathioprine
.
Subsequent
adjustment
of
doses
of
mercaptopurine
or
azathioprine
should
be
made
on
the
basis
of
therapeutic
response
and
the
appearance
of
toxic
effects
.
Dicumarol
:
It
has
been
reported
that
allopurinol
prolongs
the
half-life
of
the
anticoagulant
,
dicumarol
.
The
clinical
basis
of
this
drug
interaction
has
not
been
established
but
should
be
noted
when
allopurinol
is
given
to
patients
already
on
dicumarol
therapy
.
Consequently
,
prothrombin
time
should
be
reassessed
periodically
in
patients
receiving
both
drugs
.
Uricosuric
Agents
:
Since
the
excretion
of
oxipurinol
is
similar
to
that
of
urate
,
uricosuric
agents
,
which
increase
the
excretion
of
urate
,
are
also
likely
to
increase
the
excretion
of
oxipurinol
and
thus
lower
the
degree
of
inhibition
of
xanthine
oxidase
.
The
concomitant
administration
of
uricosuric
agents
and
allopurinol
has
been
associated
with
a
decrease
in
the
excretion
of
oxypurines
-LRB-
hypoxanthine
and
xanthine
-RRB-
and
an
increase
in
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
compared
with
that
observed
with
allopurinol
alone
.
Although
clinical
evidence
to
date
has
not
demonstrated
renal
precipitation
of
oxypurines
in
patients
either
on
allopurinol
alone
or
in
combination
with
uricosuric
agents
,
the
possibility
should
be
kept
in
mind
.
Thiazide
Diuretics
:
The
reports
that
the
concomitant
use
of
allopurinol
and
thiazide
diuretics
may
contribute
to
the
enhancement
of
allopurinol
toxicity
in
some
patients
have
been
reviewed
in
an
attempt
to
establish
a
cause-and-effect
relationship
and
a
mechanism
of
causation
.
Review
of
these
case
reports
indicates
that
the
patients
were
mainly
receiving
thiazide
diuretics
for
hypertension
and
that
tests
to
rule
out
decreased
renal
function
secondary
to
hypertensive
nephropathy
were
not
often
performed
.
In
those
patients
in
whom
renal
insufficiency
was
documented
,
however
,
the
recommendation
to
lower
the
dose
of
allopurinol
was
not
followed
.
Although
a
causal
mechanism
and
a
cause-and-effect
relationship
have
not
been
established
,
current
evidence
suggests
that
renal
function
should
be
monitored
in
patients
on
thiazide
diuretics
and
allopurinol
even
in
the
absence
of
renal
failure
,
and
dosage
levels
should
be
even
more
conservatively
adjusted
in
those
patients
on
such
combined
therapy
if
diminished
renal
function
is
detected
.
Ampicillin/Amoxicillin
:
An
increase
in
the
frequency
of
skin
rash
has
been
reported
among
patients
receiving
ampicillin
or
amoxicillin
concurrently
with
allopurinol
compared
to
patients
who
are
not
receiving
both
drugs
.
The
cause
of
the
reported
association
has
not
been
established
.
Cytotoxic
Agents
:
Enhanced
bone
marrow
suppression
by
cyclophosphamide
and
other
cytotoxic
agents
has
been
reported
among
patients
with
neoplastic
disease
,
except
leukemia
,
in
the
presence
of
allopurinol
.
However
,
in
a
well-controlled
study
of
patients
with
lymphoma
on
combination
therapy
,
allopurinol
did
not
increase
the
marrow
toxicity
of
patients
treated
with
cyclophosphamide
,
doxorubicin
,
bleomycin
,
procarbazine
and/or
mechlorethamine
.
Chlorpropamide
:
Chlorpropamides
plasma
half-life
may
be
prolonged
by
allopurinol
,
since
allopurinol
and
chlorpropamide
may
compete
for
excretion
in
the
renal
tubule
.
The
risk
of
hypoglycemia
secondary
to
this
mechanism
may
be
increased
if
allopurinol
and
chlorpropamide
are
given
concomitantly
in
the
presence
of
renal
insufficiency
.
Cyclosporin
:
Reports
indicate
that
cyclosporine
levels
may
be
increased
during
concomitant
treatment
with
allopurinol
sodium
for
injection
.
Monitoring
of
cyclosporine
levels
and
possible
adjustment
of
cyclosporine
dosage
should
be
considered
when
these
drugs
are
co-administered
.
Tolbutamides
conversion
to
inactive
metabolites
has
been
shown
to
be
catalyzed
by
xanthine
oxidase
from
rat
liver
.
The
clinical
significance
,
if
any
,
of
these
observations
is
unknown
.
Ergot-Containing
Drugs
:
These
drugs
have
been
reported
to
cause
prolonged
vasospastic
reactions
.
Because
there
is
a
theoretical
basis
that
these
effects
may
be
additive
,
use
of
ergotamine-containing
or
ergot-type
medications
-LRB-
like
dihydroergotamine
or
methysergide
-RRB-
and
AXERT
within
24
hours
of
each
other
should
be
avoided
.
Monoamine
Oxidase
Inhibitors
:
Coadministration
of
moclobemide
resulted
in
a
27
%
decrease
in
almotriptan
clearance
and
an
increase
in
Cmax
of
approximately
6
%
.
No
dose
adjustment
is
necessary
.
Other
5-HT1B
/
1D
Agonists
Concomitant
use
of
other
5-HT1B
/
1D
agonists
within
24
hours
of
treatment
with
AXERT
is
contraindicated
.
Propanolol
:
The
pharmacokinetics
of
almotriptan
were
not
affected
by
coadministration
of
propranolol
.
Selective
Serotonin
Reuptake
Inhibitors
-LRB-
SSRIs
-RRB-
:
SSRIs
-LRB-
e.g.
,
fluoxetine
,
fluvoxamine
,
paroxetine
,
sertraline
-RRB-
have
been
rarely
reported
to
cause
weakness
,
hyperreflexia
,
and
incoordination
when
coadministered
with
5-HT1
agonists
.
If
concomitant
treatment
with
AXERT
and
an
SSRI
is
clinically
warranted
,
appropriate
observation
of
the
patient
is
advised
.
Verapamil
:
Coadministration
of
almotriptan
and
verapamil
resulted
in
a
24
%
increase
in
plasma
concentrations
of
almotriptan
.
No
dose
adjustment
is
necessary
.
Coadministration
of
almotriptan
and
the
potent
CYP3A4
inhibitor
ketoconazole
-LRB-
400
mg
q.d.
for
3
days
-RRB-
resulted
in
an
approximately
60
%
increase
in
the
area
under
the
plasma
concentration-time
curve
and
maximal
plasma
concentrations
of
almotriptan
.
Although
the
interaction
between
almotriptan
and
other
potent
CYP3A4
inhibitors
-LRB-
e.g.
,
itraconazole
,
ritonavir
,
and
erythromycin
-RRB-
has
not
been
studied
,
increased
exposures
to
almotriptan
may
be
expected
when
almotriptan
is
used
concomitantly
with
these
medications
.
AXERT
is
not
known
to
interfere
with
commonly
employed
clinical
laboratory
tests
.
Because
alosetron
is
metabolized
by
a
variety
of
hepatic
CYP
drug-metabolizing
enzymes
,
inducers
or
inhibitors
of
these
enzymes
may
change
the
clearance
of
alosetron
.
Fluvoxamine
is
a
known
strong
inhibitor
of
CYP1A2
and
also
inhibits
CYP3A4
,
CYP2C9
,
and
CYP2C19
.
In
a
pharmacokinetic
study
,
40
healthy
female
subjects
received
fluvoxamine
in
escalating
doses
from
50
to
200
mg
per
day
for
16
days
,
with
coadministration
of
alosetron
1
mg
on
the
last
day
.
Fluvoxamine
increased
mean
alosetron
plasma
concentrations
-LRB-
AUC
-RRB-
approximately
6-fold
and
prolonged
the
half-life
by
approximately
3-fold
.
Concomitant
administration
of
alosetron
and
fluvoxamine
is
contraindicated
.
Concomitant
administration
of
alosetron
and
moderate
CYP1A2
inhibitors
,
including
quinolone
antibiotics
and
cimetidine
,
has
not
been
evaluated
,
but
should
be
avoided
unless
clinically
necessary
because
of
similar
potential
drug
interactions
.
Ketoconazole
is
a
known
strong
inhibitor
of
CYP3A4
.
In
a
pharmacokinetic
study
,
38
healthy
female
subjects
received
ketoconazole
200
mg
twice
daily
for
7
days
,
with
coadministration
of
alosetron
1
mg
on
the
last
day
.
Ketoconazole
increased
mean
alosetron
plasma
concentrations
-LRB-
AUC
-RRB-
by
29
%
.
Caution
should
be
used
when
alosetron
and
ketoconazole
are
administered
concomitantly
.
Coadministration
of
alosetron
and
strong
CYP3A4
inhibitors
,
such
as
clarithromycin
,
telithromycin
,
protease
inhibitors
,
voriconazole
,
and
itraconazole
has
not
been
evaluated
but
should
be
undertaken
with
caution
because
of
similar
potential
drug
interactions
.
The
effect
of
induction
or
inhibition
of
other
pathways
on
exposure
to
alosetron
and
its
metabolites
is
not
known
.
In
vitro
human
liver
microsome
studies
and
an
in
vivo
metabolic
probe
study
demonstrated
that
alosetron
did
not
inhibit
CYP
enzymes
2D6
,
3A4
,
2C9
,
or
2C19
.
In
vitro
,
at
total
drug
concentrations
27-fold
higher
than
peak
plasma
concentrations
observed
with
the
1-mg
dosage
,
alosetron
inhibited
CYP
enzymes
1A2
-LRB-
60
%
-RRB-
and
2E1
-LRB-
50
%
-RRB-
.
In
an
in
vivo
metabolic
probe
study
,
alosetron
did
not
inhibit
CYP2E1
but
did
produce
30
%
inhibition
of
both
CYP1A2
and
N-acetyltransferase
.
Although
not
studied
with
alosetron
,
inhibition
of
N-acetyltransferase
may
have
clinically
relevant
consequences
for
drugs
such
as
isoniazid
,
procainamide
,
and
hydralazine
.
The
effect
on
CYP1A2
was
explored
further
in
a
clinical
interaction
study
with
theophylline
and
no
effect
on
metabolism
was
observed
.
Another
study
showed
that
alosetron
had
no
clinically
significant
effect
on
plasma
concentrations
of
the
oral
contraceptive
agents
ethinyl
estradiol
and
levonorgestrel
-LRB-
CYP3A4
substrates
-RRB-
.
A
clinical
interaction
study
was
also
conducted
with
alosetron
and
the
CYP3A4
substrate
cisapride
.

Therefore
,
if

,
they
should
be
used
with
caution

with
frequent
monitoring
of

.
Lithium
generally
should
not
be
given
with
diuretics
because
they
reduce
its
renal
clearance

add
a
high
risk
of

.
Read
circulars
for
lithium

of
such
concomitant
therapy
.
In
some
patients
,
the
administration

,
natriuretic
,
and
antihypertensive
effects
of
loop

Therefore
,
when
MIDAMOR

closely
to
determine
if
the

Since
indomethacin

each
be
associated
with
increased

has
been
reported
during
continuous
intravenous
infusion
of
AMICAR
at
dosages
exceeding
24
g/day
.
Platelet

studies
in
these
patients
have
not
demonstrated
any
significant
platelet
dysfunction
.
However
,
in

studies
have
shown
that
at
high
concentrations
-LRB-
7.4
mMol/L
or
0.97
mg/mL

and
serotonin
,
and
the
binding
of
fibrinogen
to
the
platelets
in
a
concentration-response
manner
.
Following
a
10

of
AMICAR
,
transient
peak
plasma
concentrations
of
4.6
mMol/L
or
0.60
mg/mL
have
been
obtained
.
The
concentration
of
AMICAR
necessary
to
maintain
inhibition
of
fibrinolysis
is
0.99
mMol/L
or
0.13
mg/mL
.
Administration
of
a
5
g
bolus
followed
by
1
to
1.25
g/hr
should
achieve
and
sustain
plasma
levels
of
0.13

Thus
,
concentrations
which
have
been
obtained
in
vivo
clinically
in
patients
with
normal
renal
function
are
considerably
lower
than
the
in

concentrations
found
to
induce
abnormalities
in
platelet

tests
.
However
,
higher
plasma
concentrations
of
AMICAR
may
occur
in
patients
with
severe
renal
failure
.
Cytadren
accelerates
the
metabolism
of
dexamethasone
.
therefore
,
if
glucocorticoid

group
,
specifically
cytochromes
P450
3A4
-LRB-
CYP3A4
-RRB-
and
CYP2C8
.
The
CYP3A4
isoenzyme
is
present
in
both
the
liver
and
intestines
.
Amiodarone
is
also
known
to
be
an
inhibitor
of
CYP3A4
.
Therefore
,
amiodarone
has
the
potential
for
interactions
with
drugs
or
substances
that
may
be
substrates
,
inhibitors
or
inducers
of
CYP3A4
.
While
only
a
limited
number
of
in
vivo
drug-drug
interactions
with
amiodarone
have
been
reported
,
chiefly
with
the
oral
formulation
,
the
potential
for
other
interactions
should
be
anticipated
.
This
is
especially
important
for
drugs
associated
with
serious
toxicity
,
such
as
other
antiarrhythmics
.
If
such
drugs
are
needed
,
their
dose
should
be
reassessed
and
,
where
appropriate
,
plasma
concentration
measured
.
In
view
of
the
long
and
variable
half-life
of
amiodarone
,
potential
for
drug
interactions
exists
not
only
with
concomitant
medication
but
also
with
drugs
administered
after
discontinuation
of
amiodarone
.
Since
amiodarone
is
a
substrate
for
CYP3A4
and
CYP2C8
,
drugs/substances
that
inhibit
these
isoenzymes
may
decrease
the
metabolism
and
increase
serum
concentration
of
amiodarone
.
Reported
examples
include
the
following
:
Protease
Inhibitors
:
Protease
inhibitors
are
known
to
inhibit
CYP3A4
to
varying
degrees
.
A
case
report
of
one
patient
taking
amiodarone
200
mg
and
indinavir
800
mg
three
times
a
day
resulted
in
increases
in
amiodarone
concentrations
from
0.9
mg/L
to
1.3
mg/L
.
DEA
concentrations
were
not
affected
.
There
was
no
evidence
of
toxicity
.
Monitoring
for
amiodarone
toxicity
and
serial
measurement
of
amiodarone
serum
concentration
during
concomitant
protease
inhibitor
therapy
should
be
considered
.
Histamine
H2
antagonists
:
Cimetidine
inhibits
CYP3A4
and
can
increase
serum
amiodarone
levels
.
Other
substances
:
Grapefruit
juice
given
to
healthy
volunteers
increased
amiodarone
AUC
by
50
%
and
Cmax
by
84
%
,
resulting
in
increased
plasma
levels
of
amiodarone
.
Grapefruit
juice
should
not
be
taken
during
treatment
with
oral
amiodarone
.
This
information
should
be
considered
when
changing
from
intravenous
amiodarone
to
oral
amiodarone
.
Amiodarone
may
suppress
certain
CYP450
enzymes
,
including
CYP1A2
,
CYP2C9
,
CYP2D6
,
and
CYP3A4
.
This
inhibition
can
result
in
unexpectedly
high
plasma
levels
of
other
drugs
which
are
metabolized
by
those
CYP450
enzymes
.
Reported
examples
of
this
interaction
include
the

Cyclosporine
-LRB-
CYP3A4
substrate
-RRB-
administered
in
combination
with
oral
amiodarone
has
been
reported
to
produce
persistently
elevated
plasma
concentrations
of
cyclosporine
resulting
in
elevated

.
Cardiovasculars
:
Cardiac
glycosides
:
In
patients
receiving
digoxin
therapy
,
administration
of
oral
amiodarone
regularly
results
in
an
increase
in
serum
digoxin
concentration
that
may
reach
toxic
levels
with
resultant
clinical
toxicity
.
Amiodarone
taken
concomitantly
with
digoxin
increases
the
serum
digoxin
concentration
by
70
%
after
one
day
.
On
administration
of
oral
amiodarone
,
the
need
for
digitalis
therapy
should
be
reviewed
and
the
dose
reduced
by
approximately
50
%
or
discontinued
.
If
digitalis
treatment
is
continued
,
serum
levels
should
be
closely
monitored
and
patients
observed
for
clinical
evidence
of
toxicity
.
These
precautions
probably
should
apply
to
digitoxin
administration
as
well
.
Antiarrhythmics
:
Other
antiarrhythmic
drugs
,
such
as
quinidine
,
procainamide
,
disopyramide
,
and
phenytoin
,
have
been
used
concurrently
with
amiodarone
.
There
have
been
case
reports
of
increased
steady-state
levels
of
quinidine
,
procainamide
,
and
phenytoin
during
concomitant
therapy
with
amiodarone
.
Phenytoin
decreases
serum
amiodarone
levels
.
Amiodarone
taken
concomitantly
with
quinidine
increases
quinidine
serum
concentration
by
33
%
after
two
days
.
Amiodarone
taken
concomitantly
with
procainamide
for
less
than
seven
days
increases
plasma
concentrations
of
procainamide
and
n-acetyl
procainamide
by
55
%
and
33
%
,
respectively
.
Quinidine
and
procainamide
doses
should
be
reduced
by
one-third
when
either
is
administered
with
amiodarone
.
Plasma
levels
of
flecainide
have
been
reported
to
increase
in
the
presence
of
oral
amiodarone
.
because
of
this
,
the
dosage
of
flecainide
should
be
adjusted
when
these
drugs
are
administered
concomitantly
.
In
general
,
any
added
antiarrhythmic
drug
should
be
initiated
at
a
lower
than
usual
dose
with
careful
monitoring
.
Combination
of
amiodarone
with
other
antiarrhythmic
therapy
should
be
reserved
for
patients
with
life-threatening
ventricular
arrhythmias
who
are
incompletely
responsive
to
a
single
agent
or
incompletely
responsive
to
amiodarone
.
During
transfer
to
oral
amiodarone
,
the
dose
levels
of
previously
administered
agents
should
be
reduced
by
30
to
50
%
several
days
after
the
addition
of
oral
amiodarone
.
The
continued
need
for
the
other
antiarrhythmic
agent
should
be
reviewed
after
the
effects
of
amiodarone
have
been
established
,
and
discontinuation
ordinarily
should
be
attempted
.
If
the
treatment
is
continued
,
these
patients
should
be
particularly
carefully
monitored
for
adverse
effects
,
especially
conduction
disturbances
and
exacerbation
of
tachyarrhythmias
,
as
amiodarone
is
continued
.
In
amiodarone-treated
patients
who
require
additional
antiarrhythmic
therapy
,
the
initial
dose
of
such
agents
should
be
approximately
half
of
the
usual
recommended
dose
.
Antihypertensives
:
Amiodarone
should
be
used
with
caution
in
patients
receiving
-
receptor
blocking
agents
-LRB-
e.g.
,
propranolol
,
a
CYP3A4
inhibitor
-RRB-
or
calcium
channel
antagonists
-LRB-
e.g.
,
verapamil
,
a
CYP3A4
substrate
,
and
diltiazem
,
a
CYP3A4
inhibitor
-RRB-
because
of
the
possible
potentiation
of
bradycardia
,
sinus
arrest
,
and
AV
block
.
if
necessary
,
amiodarone
can
continue
to
be
used
after
insertion
of
a
pacemaker
in
patients
with
severe
bradycardia
or
sinus
arrest
.
Anticoagulants
:
Potentiation
of
warfarin-type
-LRB-
CYP2C9
and
CYP3A4
substrate
-RRB-
anticoagulant
response
is
almost
always
seen
in
patients
receiving
amiodarone
and
can
result
in
serious
or
fatal
bleeding
.
Since
the
concomitant
administration
of
warfarin
with
amiodarone
increases
the
prothrombin
time
by
100
%
after
3
to
4
days
,
the
dose
of
the
anticoagulant
should
be
reduced
by
one-third
to
one-half
,
and
prothrombin
times
should
be
monitored
closely
.
Some
drugs/substances
are
known
to
accelerate
the
metabolism
of
amiodarone
by
stimulating
the
synthesis
of
CYP3A4
-LRB-
enzyme
induction
-RRB-
.
This
may
lead
to
low
amiodarone
serum
levels
and
potential
decrease
in
efficacy
.
Reported
examples
of
this
interaction
include
the
following
:
Antibiotics
:
Rifampin
is
a
potent
inducer
of
CYP3A4
.
Administration
of
rifampin
concomitantly
with
oral
amiodarone
has
been
shown
to
result
in
decreases
in
serum
concentrations
of
amiodarone
and
desethylamiodarone
.
Other
substances
,
including
herbal
preparations
:
St.
John
s
Wort
-LRB-
Hypericum
perforatum
-RRB-
induces
CYP3A4
.
Since
amiodarone
is
a
substrate
for
CYP3A4
,
there
is
the
potential
that
the
use
of
St.
John
s
Wort
in
patients
receiving
amiodarone
could
result
in
reduced
amiodarone
levels
.
Other
reported
interactions
with
amiodarone
:
Fentanyl
-LRB-
CYP3A4
substrate
-RRB-
in
combination
with
amiodarone
may
cause
hypotension
,
bradycardia
,
and
decreased
cardiac
output
.
Sinus
bradycardia
has
been
reported
with
oral
amiodarone
in
combination
with
lidocaine
-LRB-
CYP3A4
substrate
-RRB-
given
for
local
anesthesia
.
Seizure
,
associated
with
increased
lidocaine
concentrations
,
has
been
reported
with
concomitant
administration
of
intravenous
amiodarone
.
Dextromethorphan
is
a
substrate
for
both
CYP2D6
and
CYP3A4
.
Amiodarone
inhibits
CYP2D6
.
Cholestyramine
increases
enterohepatic
elimination
of
amiodarone
and
may
reduce
its
serum
levels
and
t1/2
.
Disopyramide
increases
QT
prolongation
which
could
cause
arrhythmia
.
Fluoroquinolones
,
macrolide
antibiotics
,
and
azoles
are
known
to
cause
QTc
prolongation
.
There
have
been
reports
of
QTc
prolongation
,
with
or
without
TdP
,
in
patients
taking
amiodarone
when
fluoroquinolones
,
macrolide
antibiotics
,
or
azoles
were
administered
concomitantly
.
Hemodynamic
and
electrophysiologic
interactions
have
also
been
observed
after
concomitant
administration
with
propranolol
,
diltiazem
,
and
verapamil
.
Volatile

In
addition
to
the
interactions
noted
above
,
chronic

.
Electrolyte
Disturbances
Patients
with
hypokalemia
or
hypomagnesemia
should
have
the
condition
corrected
whenever
possible
before
being
treated
with
Cordarone
I.V.
,
as
these
disorders
can
exaggerate
the
degree
of
QTc
prolongation
and
increase
the
potential
for
TdP
.
Special
attention
should
be
given
to
electrolyte
and
acid-base
balance
in
patients
experiencing
severe
or
prolonged
diarrhea
or
in
patients
receiving
concomitant
diuretics

when
given

doses
Depending
on
the
fraction
of
drug
metabolized
by
P450
2D6
,
the
increase
in
plasma
concentration
may
be
small
,
or
quite
large
-LRB-
8-fold
increase
in
plasma
AUC
of
the
TCA
-RRB-
.
In
addition
,
certain
drugs
inhibit
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
and
make
normal
metabolizers
resemble
poor
metabolizers
.
An
individual
who
is
stable
on
a
given
dose
of
TCA
may
become
abruptly
toxic
when
given
one
of
these
inhibiting
drugs
as
concomitant
therapy
.
The
drugs
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450

include
some
that
are
not
metabolized
by
the

e.g.
,
fluoxetine
,

paroxetine
,
inhibit
P450
2D6
,
they
may
vary
in
the
extent
of
inhibition
.
The
extent
to
which
SSRI-TCA
interactions
may
pose
clinical
problems
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
inhibition
and
the
pharmacokinetics
of
the
SSRI
involved
.
Nevertheless
,
caution
is
indicated
in
the
coadministration
of
TCAs
with
any
of
the
SSRIs
and
also
in
switching
from
one
class
to
the
other
.
Of
particular
importance
,
sufficient
time
must
elapse
before
initiating
TCA
treatment
in
a
patient
being
withdrawn
from
fluoxetine

Concomitant
use
of
tricyclic

Limited

PD
studies
investigating
possible
interactions
between
anagrelide
and
other
medicinal
products
have
been
conducted
.
In
vivo
interaction
studies
in
humans
have
demonstrated
that
digoxin
and
warfarin
do
not
affect
the
PK
properties
of
anagrelide
,
nor
does
anagrelide
affect
the
PK
properties
of
digoxin
or
warfarin
.
Although
additional
drug
interaction
studies
have
not
been
conducted
,
the
most
common
medications
used
concomitantly
with
anagrelide
in
clinical
trials
were
aspirin
,
acetaminophen
,
furosemide
,
iron
,
ranitidine
,
hydroxyurea
,
and
allopurinol
.
There
is
no
clinical
evidence
to
suggest
that
anagrelide
interacts
with
any
of
these
compounds
.
An
in
vivo
interaction
study
in
humans
demonstrated
that
a
single
1mg
dose
of
anagrelide
administered
concomitantly
with
a
single
900
mg
dose
of
aspirin
was
generally
well
tolerated
.
There
was
no

PT
or
aPTT
.
No
clinically
relevant
pharmacokinetic
interactions
between
anagrelide
and
acetylsalicylic
acid
were
observed
.
In
that
same
study
,
aspirin
alone
produced
a
marked
inhibition
in
platelet
aggregation
ex
vivo
.
Anagrelide
alone
had
no
effect
on
platelet
aggregation
,
but
did
slightly
enhance
the
inhibition
of
platelet
aggregation
by
aspirin
.
Anagrelide
is
metabolized
at
least
in
part
by
CYP1A2
.
It
is
known
that
CYP1A2
is
inhibited
by
several
medicinal
products
,
including
fluvoxamine
,
and
such
medicinal
products
could
theoretically
adversely
influence
the
clearance
of
anagrelide
.
Anagrelide
demonstrates
some
limited
inhibitory
activity
towards
CYP1A2
which
may
present
a
theoretical
potential
for
interaction
with
other
coadministered
medicinal
products
sharing
that
clearance
mechanism

There
is

suggests
that
sucralfate

based
on
these

is
unlikely
that
co-administration

At
a

.
Based
on
clinical
and
pharmacokinetic

Estrogen-containing

Interactions
No
clinically

in
the
results

No

have
been

with

Caution
should
be
observed
when
anileridine
is
coadministered
with
other
opioids
,
sedatives
,
phenothiazines
,
or
anesthetics

as
these

.
Addition
or
deletion
of
any
drug
from
the
therapeutic
regimen
of
patients
receiving
oral
anticoagulants
may
affect
patient
response
to
the
anticoagulant
.
Frequent
determination
of
prothrombin
time
and
close
monitoring
of
the
patient
is
essential
to
ascertain
when
adjustment
of
dosage
of
anticoagulant
may
be
needed
.
Because
of
the
variability
of
individual
patient
response
,
multiple
interacting
mechanisms
with
some
drugs
,
the
dependency
of
the
extent
of
the
interaction
on
the
dosage
and
duration
of
therapy
,
and
the
possible
administration
of
several
interacting
drugs
simultaneously
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
the
direction
and
degree
of
the
ultimate
effect
of
concomitant
medications
on
anticoagulant
response
.
For
example
,
since
cholestyramine
may
reduce
the
gastrointestinal
absorption
of
both
the
oral
anticoagulants
and
vitamin
K
,
the
net
effects
are
unpredictable
.
Therefore
,
the
potential
exists
for
interaction
between
carbamazepine
and
any
agent
metabolized
by
one
-LRB-
or
more
-RRB-
of
these
enzymes
.
Agents
that
have
been
found
,

are
expected
to
have
decreased
plasma
levels
in
the

Thus
,

has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
one
of
the
agents
in
this
category
,
and
then
begins
a
course
of
treatment
with
EQUETROTM
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
dose
increase
for
the
concomitant
agent
may
be
necessary
.
Agents
with
Increased
Levels
in
the
Presence
of
Carbamazepine
:
EQUETROTM
increases
the

of
the
following
agents
:
Clomipramine
HCl
,
Phenytoin
-LRB-

-RRB-
,
and
primidone
Thus
,
if
a
patient
has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
one
of
the
agents
in

,
and
then
begins

it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a

may
be
necessary
.
Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic
Interactions
with
Carbamazepine
Concomitant
administration
of
carbamazepine
and
lithium
may
increase
the
risk
of
neurotoxic
side
effects
.
Given
the
anticonvulsant
properties
of
carbamazepine
,
EQUETROTM
may
reduce
the
thyroid
function
as
has
been
reported
with
other
anticonvulsants
.
Additionally
,
anti-malarial
drugs
,
such
as
chloroquine
and
mefloquine
,
may
antagonize
the
activity
of
carbamazepine
.
Thus
if
a
patient
has
been
titrated
to
a
stable
dosage
on
one
of
the
agents
in
this
category
,
and
then
begins
a

with
EQUETROTM
,
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
a
dose
adjustment
may
be
necessary
.
Because
of
its
primary
CNS
effect
,
caution
should
be
used
when
EQUETROTM
is
taken
with

.
Although
metoclopramide
may
increase
the
bioavailability
of

,
metoclopramide
may
also

a
beta-blocker
is
administered
to
patients
receiving
catecholamine-depleting

,
because
of
possible
additive

Inhibitors
of
CYP2D6
;
.
poor
metabolizers
of
debrisoquin
:
Interactions
of
carvedilol
with
strong
inhibitors
of
CYP2D6
-LRB-
such
as
quinidine
,
fluoxetine
,
paroxetine
,
and
propafenone
-RRB-
have
not
been
studied
,
but
these
drugs
would
be
expected
to
increase
blood
levels
of
the
R
-LRB-
+
-RRB-
enantiomer
of
carvedilol
.
Retrospective
analysis
of
side
effects
in
clinical
trials
showed
that
poor
2D6
metabolizers
had
a
higher
rate
of
dizziness
during
up-titration
,
presumably
resulting
from
vasodilating
effects
of
the
higher
concentrations
of
the
a-blocking
R
-LRB-
+
-RRB-
enantiomer
.
Catecholamine-depleting
Agents
:
Patients
taking
both
agents
with
b-blocking
properties
and
a
drug
that
can
deplete
catecholamines
-LRB-
e.g.
,
reserpine
and
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
-RRB-
should
be
observed
closely
for
signs
of
hypotension
and/or
severe
bradycardia
.
Clonidine
:
Concomitant
administration
of
clonidine
with
agents
with
b-blocking
properties
may
potentiate
blood-pressure
-
and
heart-rate-lowering
effects
.
When
concomitant
treatment
with
agents
with
b-blocking
properties
and
clonidine
is
to
be
terminated
,
the
b-blocking
agent
should
be
discontinued
first
.
Clonidine
therapy
can
then
be
discontinued
several
days
later
by
gradually
decreasing
the
dosage
.
Cyclosporine
:
Modest
increases
in
mean
trough
cyclosporine
concentrations
were
observed
following
initiation
of
carvedilol
treatment
in
21
renal
transplant
patients
suffering
from
chronic
vascular
rejection
.
In
about
30
%
of
patients
,
the
dose
of
cyclosporine
had
to
be
reduced
in
order
to
maintain
cyclosporine
concentrations
within
the
therapeutic
range
,
while
in
the
remainder
no
adjustment
was
needed
.
On
the
average
for
the
group
,
the
dose
of
cyclosporine
was
reduced
about
20
%
in
these
patients
.
Due
to
wide
interindividual
variability
in
the
dose
adjustment
required
,
it
is
recommended
that
cyclosporine
concentrations
be
monitored
closely
after
initiation
of
carvedilol
therapy
and
that
the
dose
of
cyclosporine
be
adjusted
as
appropriate
.
Digoxin
:
Digoxin
concentrations
are
increased
by
about
15
%
when
digoxin
and
carvedilol
are
administered
concomitantly
.
Both
digoxin
and
COREG
slow
AV
conduction
.
Therefore
,
increased
monitoring
of
digoxin
is
recommended
when
initiating
,
adjusting
,
or
discontinuing
COREG
.
Inducers
and
Inhibitors
of
Hepatic
Metabolism
:
Rifampin
reduced
plasma
concentrations
of
carvedilol
by
about
70
%
.
Cimetidine
increased
AUC
by
about
30
%
but
caused
no
change
in
Cmax
.
Calcium
Channel
Blockers
:
Isolated
cases
of
conduction
disturbance
-LRB-
rarely
with
hemodynamic
compromise
-RRB-
have
been
observed
when
COREG
is
co-administered
with
diltiazem
.
As
with
other
agents
with
b-blocking
properties
,
if
COREG
is
to
be
administered
orally
with
calcium
channel
blockers
of
the
verapamil
or
diltiazem
type
,
it
is
recommended
that
ECG
and
blood
pressure
be
monitored
.
Insulin
or
Oral
Hypoglycemics
:
Agents
with
b-blocking
properties
may
enhance
the
blood-sugar-reducing
effect
of
insulin
and
oral
hypoglycemics
.
Therefore
,
in
patients
taking
insulin
or
oral
hypoglycemics
,
regular
monitoring
of
blood
glucose
is
recommended
.
Studies
in
vitro
show
that
caspofungin
acetate
is
not
an
inhibitor
of
any
enzyme
in
the
cytochrome
P450
-LRB-
CYP
-RRB-
system
.
In
clinical
studies
,
caspofungin
did
not
induce
the
CYP3A4
metabolism
of
other
drugs
.
Caspofungin
is
not
a
substrate
for
P-glycoprotein
and
is
a
poor
substrate
for
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
Clinical
studies
in
healthy
volunteers
show
that
the
pharmacokinetics
of
CANCIDAS
are
not
altered
by
itraconazole
,
amphotericin
B
,
mycophenolate
,
nelfinavir
,
or
tacrolimus
.
CANCIDAS
has
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
itraconazole
,
amphotericin
B
,
or
the
active
metabolite
of
mycophenolate
.
CANCIDAS
reduced
the
blood
AUC0-12
of
tacrolimus
by
approximately
20
%
,
peak
blood
concentration
-LRB-
Cmax
-RRB-
by
16
%
,
and
12-hour
blood
concentration
-LRB-
C12hr
-RRB-
by
26
%
in
healthy
subjects
when
tacrolimus
-LRB-
2
doses
of
0.1
mg/kg
12
hours
apart
-RRB-
was
administered
on
the
10th
day
of
CANCIDAS
70
mg
daily
,
as
compared
to
results
from
a
control
period
in
which
tacrolimus
was
administered
alone
.
For
patients
receiving
both
therapies
,
standard
monitoring
of
tacrolimus
blood
concentrations
and
appropriate
tacrolimus
dosage
adjustments
are
recommended
.
In
two
clinical
studies
,
cyclosporine
-LRB-
one
4
mg/kg
dose
or
two
3
mg/kg
doses
-RRB-
increased
the
AUC
of
caspofungin
by
approximately
35
%
.
CANCIDAS
did
not
increase
the
plasma
levels
of
cyclosporine
.
There
were
transient
increases
in
liver
ALT
and
AST
when
CANCIDAS
and
cyclosporine
were
co-administered
.
A
drug-drug
interaction
study
with
rifampin
in
healthy
volunteers
has
shown
a
30
%
decrease
in
caspofungin
trough
concentrations
.
Patients
on
rifampin
should
receive
70
mg
of
CANCIDAS
daily
.
In
addition
,
results
from
regression
analyses
of
patient
pharmacokinetic
data
suggest
that
co-administration
of
other
inducers
of
drug
clearance
-LRB-
efavirenz
,
nevirapine
,
phenytoin
,
dexamethasone
,
or
carbamazepine
-RRB-
with
CANCIDAS
may
result
in
clinically
meaningful
reductions
in
caspofungin
concentrations
.
It
is
not
known
which
drug
clearance
mechanism
involved
in
caspofungin
disposition
may
be
inducible
.
When
CANCIDAS
is
co-administered
with
inducers
of
drug
clearance
,
such
as
efavirenz
,
nevirapine
,
phenytoin
,
dexamethasone
,
or
carbamazepine
,
use
of
a
daily
dose
of
70
mg
of
CANCIDAS
should
be
considere
.
Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
Positive
direct
Coombs
tests
have
been
reported
during
treatment
with
the
cephalosporin
antibiotics
.
In
hematologic
studies
or
in
transfusion
cross-matching
procedures
when
anti-globulin
tests
are
performed
on
the
minor

or
in
Coombs
testing
of
newborns
whose
mothers
have
received
cephalosporin
antibiotics
before
parturition
,
it
should
be
recognized
that
a
positive
Coombs
test
may
be
due
to
the
drug
.
Probenecid
may
decrease
renal
tubular
secretion
of
cephalosporins
when
used
concurrently
,
resulting
in
increased

.
Antacids
-LRB-
aluminum

:
Concomitant
administration
of
300-mg
cefdinir

by
approximately
40
%
.
Time
to
reach
Cmax
is
also
prolonged
by
1
hour
.
There
are
no
significant
effects
on
cefdinir
pharmacokinetics
if
the
antacid
is
administered
2
hours
before
or
2
hours
after
cefdinir
.
If
antacids
are
required
during
OMNICEF
therapy
,
OMNICEF
should
be
taken
at
least
2
hours
before
or
after
the
antacid
.
Probenecid
:
As
with
other
b-lactam
antibiotics
,
probenecid
inhibits
the
renal
excretion
of
cefdinir
,
resulting
in
an
approximate
doubling
in
A.C.
a
54
%
increase
in
peak
cefdinir
plasma
levels
,
and
a
50
%
prolongation
in
the
apparent
elimination
half-life
.
Iron
Supplements
and
Foods
Fortified
With
Iron
Concomitant
administration
of
cefdinir
with
a
therapeutic
iron
supplement
containing
60
mg
of
elemental
iron
-LRB-
as
FeSO4
-RRB-
or
vitamins
supplemented
with
10
mg
of
elemental
iron
reduced
extent
of
absorption
by
80
%
and
31
%
,
respectively
.
If
iron
supplements
are
required
during
OMNICEF
therapy
,
OMNICEF
should
be
taken
at
least
2
hours
before

.
The

iron-fortified
infant
formula
-LRB-
2.2
mg
elemental
iron/6
oz
-RRB-
has
no
significant
effect
on
cefdinir
pharmacokinetics
.
Therefore
,
OMNICEF
for
Oral
Suspension
can
be
administered
with
iron-fortified

.
There
have
been
rare
reports
of
reddish
stools
in
patients
who
have
received
cefdinir
in
Japan
.
The
reddish
color
is
due
to
the
formation
of
a
nonabsorbable
complex
between
cefdinir
or
its
breakdown
products
and
iron
in
the

As

,
it
is
recommended
that

be
used
to
determine

General
:
Significant
interactions
may
occur
when
celecoxib
is
administered
together
with
drugs
that
inhibit
P450
2C9
.
Celecoxib
metabolism
is
predominantly
mediated
via
cytochrome
P450
2C9
in
the
liver
.
Co-administration
of
celecoxib
with
drugs
that
are
known
to
inhibit
2C9
should
be
done
with
caution
.
In
vitro
studies
indicate
that
celecoxib
is
not
an
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
2C9
,
2C19
or
3A4
.
In
vitro
studies
also
indicate
that
celecoxib
,
although
not
a
substrate
,
is
an
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
2D6
.
Therefore
,
there
is
a
potential
for
an
in
vivo
drug
interaction
with
drugs
that
are
metabolized
by
P450
2D6
.
Clinical
studies
with
celecoxib
have
identified
potentially
significant
interactions
with
fluconazole
and
lithium
.
Experience
with
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
-LRB-
NSAIDs
-RRB-
suggests
the
potential
for
interactions
with
furosemide
and
ACE
inhibitors
.
The
effects
celecoxib
on
the
pharmacokinetics
and/or
pharmacodynamics
of
glyburide
,
ketoconazole
,
methotrexate
,
phenytoin
,
tolbutamide
,
and
warfarin
have
been
studied
in
vivo
and
clinically
important
interactions
have
not
been
found
.
ACE
inhibitors
:
Reports
suggest
that
NSAIDs
may
diminish
the
antihypertensive
effect
of
Angiotensin
Converting
Enzyme
-LRB-
ACE
-RRB-
inhibitors
.
This
interaction
should
be
given
consideration
in
patients
taking
CELEBREX
concomitantly
with
ACE-inhibitors
.
Furosemide
:
Clinical
studies
,
as
well
as
post
marketing
observations
,
have
shown
that
NSAIDs
can
reduce
the
natriuretic
effect
of
furosemide
and
thiazides
in
some
patients
.
This
response
has
been
attributed
to
inhibition
of
renal
prostaglandin
synthesis
.
Aspirin
:
CELEBREX
can
be
used
with
low
dose
aspirin
.
However
,
concomitant
administration
of
aspirin
with
CELEBREX
may
result
in
an
increased
rate
of
GI
ulceration
or
other
complications
,
compared
to
use
of
CELEBREX
alone
.
Because
of
its
lack
of
platelet
effects
,
CELEBREX
is
not
a
substitute
for
aspirin
for
cardiovascular
prophylaxis
.
Fluconazole
:
Concomitant
administration
of
fluconazole
at
200
mg
QD
resulted
in
a
two-fold
increase
in
celecoxib
plasma
concentration
.
This
increase
is
due
to
the
inhibition
of
celecoxib
metabolism
via
P450
2C9
by
fluconazole
-LRB-
see
CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY
-
Pharmacokinetics
:
Metabolism
-RRB-
.
CELEBREX
should
be
introduced
at
the
lowest
recommended
dose
in
patients
receiving
fluconazole
.
Lithium
:
In
a
study
conducted
in
healthy
subjects
,
mean
steady-state
lithium
plasma
levels
increased
approximately
17
%
in
subjects
receiving
lithium
450
mg
BID
with
CELEBREX
200
mg
BID
as
compared
to
subjects
receiving
lithium
alone
.
Patients
on
lithium
treatment
should
be
closely
monitored
when
CELEBREX
is
introduced
or
withdrawn
.
Methotrexate
:
In
an
interaction
study
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
patients
taking
methotrexate
,
CELEBREX
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
methotrexate
.
Warfarin
:
The
effect
of
celecoxib
on
the
anti-coagulant
effect
of
warfarin
was
studied
in
a
group
of
healthy
subjects
receiving
daily
doses
of
2-5
mg
of
warfarin
.
In
these
subjects
,
celecoxib
did
not
alter
the
anticoagulant
effect
of
warfarin
as
determined
by
prothrombin
time
.
However
,
caution
should
be
used
when
administering
CELEBREX
with
warfarin
since
these
patients
are
at
increased
risk
of
bleeding
complications
.
Metformin
:
In
healthy
subjects
given
single
500
mg
doses
of
cephalexin
and
metformin
,
plasma
metformin
mean
cmax
and
AUC
increased
by
an
average
of
34
%
and
24
%
,
respectively
,
and
metformin
mean
renal
clearance
decreased
by
14
%
.
No
information
is
available
about
the
interaction
of
cephalexin
and
metformin
following
multiple
doses
of
either
drug
.
Although
not
observed
in
this
study
,
adverse
effects
could
potentially
arise
from
co-administration
of
cephalexin
and
metformin
by
inhibition
of
tubular
secretion
via
organic
cationic
transporter
systems
.
Accordingly

.
CIMETlDINE
:
Cerivastatin
plasma
concentrations
were
not

.
CHOLESTYRAMINE
:
The
influence
of
the
bile-acidsequestering
agent
cholestyramine
on
the
pharmacokinetits
of
cerivastatin
sodium
was
evaluated
in
12
healthy
males
in
2
separate
randomized
crossover
studies
.
In
the
first
study
,
concomitant
administration
of
0.2
mg
cerivastatin
sodium
and
12
g
cholestyramine
resulted
in
decreases
of
more
than
22
%
for
AUC
and
40
%
for
Cmax
when
compared
to
dosing
cerivastatin
sodium
alone
.
However
,
in
the
second
study
,
administration
of
12
g
cholestyramine
1
hour
before
the
evening
meal
and
0.3
mg
cerivastatin
sodium
approximately
4
hours
after
the
same
evening
meal
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
cerivastatin
AUC
of
less
than
8
%
,
and
a
decrease
in
Cmax
of
about
30
%
when
compared
to
dosing
cerivastatin
sodium
alone
.
Therefore
,
it
would
be
expected
that
a
dosing
schedule
of
cerivastatin
sodium
given
at
bedtime
and
cholestyramine
given
before
the
evening
meal
would
not
result
in
a
significant
decrease
in
the
clinical
effect
of
cerivastatin
sodium
.
DIGOXIN
:
Plasma
digoxin
levels
and
digoxin
clearance
at
steady-state
were
not
affected
by
co-administration
of
0.2
mg
cerivastatin
sodium
.
Cerivastatin
plasma
concentrations
were
also
not
affected
by
co-administration
of
digoxin
.
WARFARIN
:
Co
-
administration
of
warfarin
and
cerivastatin
to
healthy
volunteers
did
not
result
in
any
changes
in
prothrombin
time
or
clotting
factor
VII
when
compared
to
co-administration
of
warfarin
and
placebo
.
The
AUC
and
Cmax
of
both
the
-LRB-
R
-RRB-
and
-LRB-
S
-RRB-
isomers
of
warfarin
were
unaffected
by
concurrent
dosing
of
0.3
mg
cerivastatin
sodium
.
Co-administration
of
warfarin
and
cerivastatin
did
not
alter
the
pharmacokinetics
of
cerivastatin
sodium
.
ERYTHROMYCIN
:
In
hypercholesterolemic
patients
,
steady-state
cerivastatin
AUC
and
Cmax
increased
approximately
50
%
and
24
%
respectively
after
10
days
with
co-administration
of
erythromycin
,
a
known
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450

OTHER
CONCOMITANT
THERAPY
:
Although
specific
interaction
studies
were
not
performed
,
in
clinical
studies
,
cerivastatin
sodium
was
used
concomitantly
with
angiotensin
-
converting
enzyme
-LRB-
ACE
-RRB-
inhibitors
,
betablockers
,
calcium-channel
blockers
,
diuretics
,
and
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
-LRB-
NSAIDs
-RRB-
without
evidence
of
clinically
significant
adverse
interactions
.
Pharmacokinetic
interaction
studies
with
cetirizine
in
adults
were
conducted
with
pseudoephedrine
,
antipyrine
,
ketoconazole
,
erythromycin
and
azithromycin
.
No
interactions
were
observed
In
a
multiple
dose
study
of
theophylline
-LRB-
400
mg
once
daily
for
3
days
-RRB-
and
cetirizine
-LRB-
20
mg
once
daily
for
3
days
-RRB-
,
a
16
%
decrease
in
the
clearance
of
cetirizine
was
observed
.
The
disposition
of
theophylline
was
not
altered
by
concomitant
cetirizine
administration
.
Drug-Drug
Interactions
:
No
clinically
significant
drug
interactions
have
been
found
with
theophylline
at
a
low
dose
,
azithromycin
,
pseudoephedrine
,
ketoconazole
,
or
erythromycin
.
There
was
a
small
decrease
in
the
clearance
of
cetirizine
caused
by
a
400-mg
dose
of
theophylline
.
it
is
possible
that
larger
theophylline
doses
could
have
a
greater
effect
.
No
formal
drug
interaction
studies
have
been
performed
with
Cetrotide
.
A
drug
interaction
study
was
performed
in
which
ERBITUX
was
administered
in
combination
with
irinotecan
.
There
was
no
evidence
of
any
pharmacokinetic
interactions
between
ERBITUX
and
irinotecan
.
Cevimeline
should
be
administered
with
caution
to
patients
taking
beta
adrenergic
antagonists
,
because
of
the
possibility
of
conduction
disturbances
.
Drugs
with
parasympathomimetic
effects
administered
concurrently
with
cevimeline
can
be
expected
to
have
additive
effects
.
Cevimeline
might
interfere
with
desirable
antimuscarinic
effects
of
drugs
used
concomitantly
.
Drugs
which
inhibit
CYP2D6
and
CYP3A3/4
also
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
cevimeline
.
Cevimeline
should
be
used
with
caution
in
individuals
known
or
suspected
to
be
deficient
in
CYP2D6
activity
,
based
on
previous
experience
,
as
they
may
be
at
a
higher
risk
of
adverse
events
.
In
an
in
vitro
study
,
cytochrome

isozymes
1A2
,
2A6
,
2C9
,
2C19
,
2D6
,
2E1
,
and
3A4
were
not
inhibited
by
exposure
to
cevimeline
.
There
are
no
known
drug/drug
interactions
with
chlorambucil
.
Although
clinical
studies
have
not
established
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
,
physicians
should
be
aware
that
variable
effects
an
blood
coagulation
have
been
reported
very
rarely
in
patients
receiving
oral
anticoagulants
and
chlordiazepoxide
.
The
concomitant
use
of
alcohol
or
other
central
nervous
system
depressants
may
have
an
additive
effect
.
The
administration
of
local
anesthetic
solutions
containing
epinephrine
or
norepinephrine
to
patients
receiving
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors
,
tricyclic
antidepressants
or
phenothiazines
may
produce
severe
,
prolonged
hypotension
or
hypertension
.
Concurrent
use
of
these
agents
should
generally
be
avoided
.
In
situations
when
concurrent
therapy
is
necessary
,
careful
patient
monitoring
is
essential
.
Concurrent
administration
of
vasopressor
drugs
-LRB-
for
the
treatment
of
hypotension
related
to
obstetric
blocks
-RRB-
and
ergot-type
oxytocic
drugs
may
cause
severe
,
persistent
hypertension
or
cerebrovascular
accidents
.
The
para-aminobenzoic
acid
metabolite
of
chloroprocaine
inhibits
the
action
of
sulfonamides
.
Therefore
,
chloroprocaine
should
not
be
used
in
any
condition
in
which
a
sulfonamide
drug
is
being
employed
.
Antacids
and
kaolin
:
Antacids
and
kaolin
can
reduce
absorption
of
chloroquine
.
an
interval
of
at
least
4
hours
between
intake
of
these
agents
and
chloroquine
should
be
observed
.
Cimetidine
:
Cimetidine
can
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
chloroquine
,
increasing
its
plasma
level
.
Concomitant
use
of
cimetidine
should
be
avoided
.
Ampicillin
:
In
a
study
of
healthy
volunteers
,
chloroquine
significantly
reduced
the
bioavailability
of
ampicillin
.
An
interval
of
at
least
two
hours
between
intake
of
this
agent
and
chloroquine
should
be
observed
.
Cyclosporin
:
After
introduction
of
chloroquine
-LRB-
oral
form
-RRB-
,
a
sudden
increase
in
serum
cyclosporin
level
has
been
reported
.
Therefore
,
close
monitoring
of
serum
cyclosporin
level
is
recommended
and
,
if
necessary
,
chloroquine
should
be
discontinued
.

:
Cholestytamine
and
colestipol
resins
have
the
potential
of
binding
thiazide
diuretics
and
reducing
diuretic
absorption
from
the

.
-
Lithium
:
Generally
should
not
be
given
with
diuretics
.
Diuretic
agents
reduce
the
renal
clearance
of
lithium
and
add
a
high
risk
of
lithium
toxicity
.
Refer
to
the
package

Non-steroidal
Anti-inflammatory
Drugs
:
In
some
patients
,
the
administration
of
a
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
agent
can
reduce
the
diuretic
,
natriuretic
,
and
antihypertensive
effects
of
loop
,
potassium-sparing
and
thiazide
diuretics
.
Therefore
,
when
chlorothiazide
and
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
are
used
concomitantly
,
the
patient
should

Certain
drugs
tend
to
produce
hyperglycemia

Medication
such
as

also
influence
serum
electrolytes
.
Warning
signs
,
irrespective
of

,
are
:
dryness
of

,
and
gastrointestinal
disturbances
such
as
nausea

Chlorthalidone
and
related
drugs
may
increase
the

This
diminution
is
not
sufficient

Interactions
for
vitamin
D
analogues
-LRB-
Vitamin
D2
,
Vitamin
D3
,
Calcitriol
,
and
Calcidiol
-RRB-
:
Cholestyramine
:
Cholestyramine
has
been
reported
to
reduce
intestinal
absorption
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
.
as
such
it
may
impair
intestinal
absorption
of
any
of
vitamin
D.
Phenytoin/Phenobarbital
:
The
coadministration
of
phenytoin
or
phenobarbital
will
not
affect
plasma
concentrations
of
vitamin
D
,
but
may
reduce
endogenous
plasma
levels
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
by
accelerating
metabolism
.
Since
blood
level
of
calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
will
be
reduced
,
higher
doses
of
Rocaltrol
may
be
necessary
if
these
drugs
are
administered
simultaneously
.
Thiazides
:
Thiazides
are
known
to
induce
hypercalcemia
by
the
reduction
of
calcium
excretion
in
urine
.
Some
reports
have
shown
that
the
concomitant
administration
of
thiazides
with
vitamin
D
causes
hypercalcemia
.
Therefore
,
precaution
should
be
taken
when
coadministration
is
necessary
.
Digitalis
:
Vitamin
D
dosage
must
be
determined
with
care
in
patients
undergoing
treatment
with
digitalis
,
as
hypercalcemia
in
such
patients
may
precipitate
cardiac
arrhythmias
.
Ketoconazole
:
Ketoconazole
may
inhibit
both
synthetic
and
catabolic
enzymes
of
vitamin
D.
Reductions
in
serum
endogenous
vitamin
D
concentrations
have
been
observed
following
the
administration
of
300
mg/day
to
1200
mg/day
ketoconazole
for
a
week
to
healthy
men
.
However
,
in
vivo
drug
interaction
studies
of
ketoconazole
with
vitamin
D
have
not
been
investigated
.
Corticosteroids
:
A
relationship
of
functional
antagonism
exists
between
vitamin
D
analogues
,
which
promote
calcium
absorption
,
and
corticosteroids
,
which
inhibit
calcium
absorption
.
Phosphate-Binding
Agents
:
Since
vitamin
D
also
has
an
effect
on
phosphate
transport
in
the
intestine
,
kidneys
and
bones
,
the
dosage
of
phosphate-binding
agents
must
be
adjusted
in
accordance
with
the
serum
phosphate
concentration
.
Vitamin
D
:
The
coadministration
of
any
of
the
vitamin
D
analogues
should
be
avoided
as
this
could
create
possible
additive
effects
and
hypercalcemia
.
Calcium
Supplements
:
Uncontrolled
intake
of
additional
calcium-containing
preparations
should
be
avoided
.
Magnesium
:
Magnesium-containing
preparations
-LRB-
eg
,
antacids
-RRB-
may
cause
hypermagnesemia
and
should
therefore
not
be
taken
during
therapy
with
vitamin
D
by
patients
on
chronic
renal
dialysis
.
Cholestyramine
resin
may
delay
or
reduce
the
absorption
of
concomitant
oral
medication
such
as
phenylbutazone
,
warfarin
,
thiazide
diuretics
-LRB-
acidic
-RRB-
or
propranolol
-LRB-
basic
-RRB-
,
as
well
as
tetracycline
penicillin
G
,
phenobarbital
,
thyroid
and
thyroxine
preparations
,
estrogens
and
progestins
,
and
digitalis
.
Interference
with
the
absorption
of
oral
phosphate
supplements
has
been
observed
with
another
positively-charged
bile
acid
sequestrant
.
Cholestyramine
resin
may
interfere
with
the
pharmacokinetics
of
drugs
that
undergo
enterohepatic
circulation
,
The
discontinuance
of
cholestyramine
resin
could
pose
a
hazard
to
health
if
a
potentially
toxic
drug
such
as
digitalis
has
been
filtrated
to
a
maintenance
level
while
the
patient
was
taking
cholestyramine
resin
.
Because
cholestyramine
binds
bile
acids
,
cholestyramine
resin
may
interfere
with
normal
fat
digestion
and
absorption
and
thus
may
prevent
absorption
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
such
as
A
,
D
,
E
,
and
K
.
When
cholestyramine
resin
is
given
for
long
periods
of
time
,
concomitant
supplementation
with
water-miscible
-LRB-
or
parenteral
-RRB-
forms
of
fat-soluble
vitamins
should
be
considered
.
SINCE
CHOLESTYRAMINE
RESIN
MAY
BIND
OTHER
DRUGS
GIVEN
CONCURRENTLY
,
IT
IS
RECOMMENDED
THAT

AT
AS
GREAT
AN

AVOID
IMPEDING
THEIR
ABSORPTION
.
Based
on
in
vitro
studies
in
human
liver
microsomes
,
des-ciclesonide
appears
to
have
no
inhibitory
or
induction
potential
on
the
metabolism
of
other
drugs
metabolized
by
CYP
450
enzymes
.
The
inhibitory
potential
of
ciclesonide
on
CYP450
isoenzymes
has
not
been
studied
.
In
vitro
studies
demonstrated
that
the
plasma
protein
binding
of
des-ciclesonide
was
not
affected
by
warfarin
or
salicylic
acid
,
indicating
no
potential
for
protein
binding-based
drug
interactions
.
In
a
drug
interaction
study
,
co-administration
of
orally
inhaled
ciclesonide
and
oral
erythromycin
,
an
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
had
no
effect
on
the
pharmacokinetics
of
either
des-ciclesonide
or
erythromycin
.
In
another
drug
interaction
study
,
co-administration
of
orally
inhaled
ciclesonide
and
oral
ketoconazole
,
a
potent
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P450
3A4
,
increased
the
exposure
-LRB-
AUC
-RRB-
of
des-ciclesonide
by
approximately
3.6-fold
at
steady
state
,
while
levels
of
ciclesonide
remained
unchanged
.
Therefore
,
ketoconazole
should
be
administered
with
caution
with
intranasal
ciclesonide
.
Probenecid
:
Probenecid
is
known
to
interact
with
the
metabolism
or
renal
tubular
excretion
of
many
drugs
-LRB-
e.g.
,
acetaminophen
,
acyclovir
,
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
,
aminosalicylic
acid
,
barbiturates
,
benzodiazepines
,
bumetanide
,
clofibrate
,
methotrexate
,
famotidine
,
furosemide
,
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
,
theophylline
,
and
zidovudine
-RRB-
.
Concomitant
medications
should
be
carefully
assessed
.
Zidovudine
should
either
be
temporarily
discontinued
or
decreased
by
50
%
when
coadministered
with
probenecid
on
the
day
of
VISTIDE
infusion
.
Nephrotoxic
agents
:
Concomitant
administration
of
VISTIDE
and
agents
with
nephrotoxic
potential
-LSB-
e.g.
,
intravenous
aminoglycosides
-LRB-
e.g.
,
tobramycin
,
gentamicin
,
and
amikacin
-RRB-
,
amphotericin
B
,
foscarnet
,
intravenous
pentamidine
,
vancomycin
,
and
non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
-RSB-
is
contraindicated
.
Such
agents
must
be
discontinued
at
least
seven
days
prior
to
starting
therapy
with
VISTIDE
.
Since
PLETAL
is
extensively
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P-450
isoenzymes
,
caution
should
be
exercised
when
PLETAL
is
coadministered
with
inhibitors
of
C.P.A.
such
as
ketoconazole
and
erythromycin
or
inhibitors
of
CYP2C19
such
as
omeprazole
.
Pharmacokinetic
studies
have
demonstrated
that
omeprazole
and
erythromycin
significantly
increased
the
systemic
exposure
of
cilostazol
and/or
its
major
metabolites
.
Population
pharmacokinetic
studies
showed
higher
concentrations
of
cilostazol
among
patients
concurrently
treated
with
diltiazem
,
an
inhibitor
of
C.P.A.
Pletal
does
not
,
however
,
appear
to
cause
increased
blood
levels
of
drugs
metabolized
by
CYP3A4
,
as
it
had
no
effect
on
lovastatin
,
a
drug
with
metabolism
very
sensitive
to
C.P.A.
inhibition
.
Tagamet
,
apparently
through
an
effect
on
certain
microsomal
enzyme
systems
,
has
been
reported
to
reduce
the
hepatic
metabolism
of
warfarin-type
anticoagulants
,
phenytoin
,
propranolol
,
nifedipine
,
chlordiazepoxide
,
diazepam
,
certain
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
lidocaine
,
theophylline
and
metronidazole
,
thereby
delaying
elimination
and
increasing
blood
levels
of
these
drugs
.
Clinically
significant
effects
have
been
reported
with
the
warfarin
anticoagulants
.
therefore
,
close
monitoring
of
prothrombin
time
is
recommended
,
and
adjustment
of
the
anticoagulant
dose
may
be
necessary
when
Tagamet
is
administered
concomitantly
.
Interaction

Ketoconazole
:
Sensipar
is

part
by
CYP3A4
.
Co-administration
of
ketoconazole
,
a
strong

ADMINISTRATION
-RRB-
.
Elevated
plasma
levels
of
theophylline
have
been
reported
with
concomitant
use
of
some
quinolones
.
There
have
been
reports
of
theophylline-related
side-effects
in
patients
on
concomitant
theophylline-quinolone
therapy
.
Therefore
,
monitoring
of
theophylline
plasma
levels
should
be
considered
and
dosage
of
theophylline
adjusted
as
required
.
Quinolones
have
also
been
shown
to
interfere
with
the
metabolism
of
caffeine
.
This
may
lead
to
reduced
clearance
of
caffeine
and
a
prolongation
of
its
plasma
half-life
.
Although
this
interaction
has
not
been
reported
with
cinoxacin
,
caution
should
be
exercised
when
cinoxacin
is
given
concomitantly
with
caffeine-containing
products
.
Antacids
or
sucralfate

Videx
-LRB-
didanosine
-RRB-
chewable/buffered
tablets
or
the
pediatric

for
oral
solution
may
result
in

.
Quinolones
,
including
cinoxacin
,
may
enhance
the
effects
of
oral
anticoagulants
,
such
as
warfarin
or
its
derivatives
.
When
these
products
are
administered
concomitantly
,
prothrombin
time
or
other
suitable
coagulation
tests
should
be
closely
monitored
.
Seizures
have
been
reported
in
patients
taking
another
quinolone
class
antimicrobial
and
the
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
fenbufen
concurrently
.
Animal
studies
also
suggest
an
increased
potential
for
seizures
when
these
2
drugs
are
given
concomitantly
.
Fenbufen
is
not
approved
in
the
United
States
at
this
time
.
Physicians
are
provided
this
information
to
increase
awareness
of
the
potential
for
serious
interactions
when
cinoxacin
and
certain
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
agents
are
administered
concomitantly
.
Elevated
cyclosporine
serum
levels
have
been
reported
with
the
concomitant
use
of
quinolones
and
cyclosporine
.
Some
quinolones
,
including
ciprofloxacin
,
have
also
been
shown
to
interfere
with
the
metabolism
of
caffeine
.
This
may
lead
to
reduced
clearance
of
caffeine
and
a
prolongation
of
its
serum
half-life
.
Some
quinolones
,
including
ciprofloxacin
,
have
been
associated
with
transient
elevations
in
serum
creatinine
in
patients
receiving
cyclosporine
concomitantly
.
Glyburide
:
The
concomitant
administration
of
ciprofloxacin
with
the
sulfonylurea
glyburide
has
,
on
rare
occasions
,
resulted
in
severe
hypoglycemia
.
Histamine
H2-receptor
antagonists
:
Histamine
H2-receptor
antagonists
appear
to
have
no
significant
effect
on
the
bioavailability
of
ciprofloxacin
.
Methotrexate
Renal
tubular
transport
of
methotrexate
may
be
inhibited
by
concomitant
administration
of
ciprofloxacin
,
potentially
leading
to
increased
plasma
levels
of
methotrexate
.
This
might
increase
the
risk
of
methotrexate
toxic
reactions
.
Therefore
,
patients
under
methotrexate
therapy
should
be
carefully
monitored
when
concomitant
ciprofloxacin
therapy
is
indicated
.
Multivalent
Cation-Containing
Products
:
Concurrent
administration
of
a
quinolone
,
including
ciprofloxacin
,
with
multivalent
cation-containing
products
such
as
magnesium
or
aluminum
antacids
,
sucralfate
,
VIDEX
chewable/buffered
tablets
or
pediatric
powder
,
or
products
containing
calcium
,
iron
,
or
zinc
may
substantially
decrease
the
absorption
of
ciprofloxacin
,
resulting
in
serum
and
urine
levels
considerably
lower
than
desired
.
Proquin
XR
should
be
administered
at
least
4
hours
before
or
2
hours
after
these
products
.
This
time
window
is
different
than
for
other
oral
formulations
of
ciprofloxacin
,
which
are
usually
administered
2
hours
before
or
6
hours
after
antacids
.
Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs
-LRB-
but
not
aspirin
-RRB-
:
These
drugs
in
combination
with
very
high
doses
of
quinolones
have
been
shown
to
provoke
convulsions
in
pre-clinical
studies
.
Omeprazole
:
The
rate
and
extent
of
absorption
of
ciprofloxacin
was
bioequivalent
when
Proquin
XR
was
given
alone
or
when
Proquin
XR
was
given
2
hours
after
omeprazole
at
the
dose
that
maximally
suppresses
gastric
acid
secretion
.
Omeprazole
should
be
taken
as
directed
and
Proquin
XR
should
be
taken
with
a
main
meal
of
the
day
,
preferably
the
evening
meal
.
Phenytoin
:
Altered
serum
levels
of
phenytoin
-LRB-
increased
and
decreased
-RRB-
have
been
reported
in
patients
receiving
concomitant
ciprofloxacin
.
Probenecid
:
Probenecid
interferes
with
renal
tubular
secretion
of
ciprofloxacin
and
produces
an
increase
in
the
level
of
ciprofloxacin
in
serum
.
Theophylline
:
As
with
some
other
quinolones
,
concurrent
administration
of
ciprofloxacin
with
theophylline
may
lead
to
elevated
serum
concentrations
of
theophylline
and
prolongation
of
its
elimination
half-life
.
This
may
result
in
increased
risk
of
theophylline-related
adverse
reactions
.
If
concomitant
use
can
not
be
avoided
,
serum
levels
of
theophylline
should
be
monitored
and
dosage
adjustments
made
as
appropriate
.
Warfarin
:
Quinolones
have
been
reported
to
enhance
the
effects
of
the
oral
anticoagulant
warfarin
or
its
derivatives
.
When
these
products
are
administered
concomitantly
,
prothrombin
time
or
other
suitable
coagulation
tests
should
be
monitored
.
Cisapride
is
metabolized
mainly
via
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
enzyme
.
In
some
cases
where
serious
ventricular
arrhythmias
,
QT
prolongation
,
and
torsades
de
pointes
have
occurred
when
cisapride
was
taken
in
conjunction
with
one
of
the
cytochrome
P450
3A4
inhibitors
,
elevated
blood
cisapride
levels
were
noted
at
the
time
of
the
QT
prolongation
.
Antibiotics
:
In
vitro
and/or
in
vivo
data
show
that
clarithromycin
,
erythromycin
,
and
troleandomycin
markedly
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
cisapride
,
which
can
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
cisapride
levels
and
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
on
the
ECG
.
Anticholinergics
:
Concurrent
administration
of
certain
anticholinergic
compounds
,
such
as
belladonna
alkaloids
and
dicyclomine
,
would
be
expected
to
compromise
the
beneficial
effects
of
cisapride
.
Anticoagulants
-LRB-
Oral
-RRB-
:
In
patients
receiving
oral
anticoagulants
,
the
coagulation
times
were
increased
in
some
cases
.
It
is
advisable
to
check
coagulation
time
within
the
first
few
days
after
the
start
and
discontinuation
of
cisapride
therapy
,
with
an
appropriate
adjustment
of
the
anticoagulant
dose
,
if
necessary
.
Antidepressants
:
In
vitro
data
indicate
that
nefazodone
inhibits
the
metabolism
of
cisapride
,
which
can
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
cisapride
levels
and
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
on
the
ECG
.
Antifungals
:
In
vitro
and/or
in
vivo
data
indicate
that
fluconazole
,
itraconazole
,
and
oral
ketoconazole
markedly
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
cisapride
,
which
can
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
cisapride
levels
and
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
on
the
ECG
.
Human
pharmacokinetic
data
indicate
that
oral
ketoconazole
markedly
inhibits
the
metabolism
of
cisapride
,
resulting
in
a
mean
eight-fold
increase
in
AUC
of
cisapride
.
A
study
in
14
normal
male
and
female
volunteers
suggests
that
coadministration
of
cisapride
and
ketoconazole
can
result
in
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
on
the
ECG
.
H2
Receptor
Antagonists
:
Cimetidine
coadministration
leads
to
an
increased
peak
plasma
concentration
and
AUC
of
cisapride
,
there
is
no
effect
on
cisapride
absorption
when
it
is
coadministered
with
ranitidine
.
The
gastrointestinal
absorption
of
cimetidine
and
ranitidine
is
accelerated
when
they
are
coadministered
with
cisapride
.
Protease
Inhibitors
:
In
vitro
data
indicate
that
indinavir
and
ritonavir
markedly
inhibit
the
metabolism
of
cisapride
which
can
result
in
an
increase
in
plasma
cisapride
levels
and
prolongation
of
the
QT
interval
on
the
ECG
.
Other
:
Coadministration
of
grapefruit
juice
with
cisapride
increases
the
bioavailability
of
cisapride
and
concomitant
use
should
be
avoided
.
Cisapride
should
not
be
used
concomitantly
with
other
drugs
known
to
prolong
the
QT
interval
:
certain
antiarrhythmics
,
including
those
of
Class
IA
-LRB-
such
as
quinidine
and
procainamide
-RRB-
and
Class
III
-LRB-
such
as
sotalol
-RRB-
.
tricyclic
antidepressants
-LRB-
such
as
amitriptyline
-RRB-
.
certain
tetracyclic
antidepressants
-LRB-
such
as
maprotiline
-RRB-
.
certain
antipsychotic
medications
-LRB-
such
as
sertindole
-RRB-
.
astemizole
,
bepridil
,
sparfloxacin
,
and
terodiline
.
The
preceding
lists
of
drugs
are
not
comprehensive
.
The
acceleration
of
gastric
emptying
by
cisapride
could
affect
the
rate
of
absorption
of
other
drugs
.
Patients
receiving
narrow
therapeutic
ratio
drugs
or
other
drugs
that
require
careful
titration
should
be
followed
closely
;
.
if
plasma
levels
are
being
monitored
,
they
should
be
reassessed
.

dose
of
succinylcholine
-LRB-
1
mg/kg

produced
95
%
neuromuscular
block
.
The
time
to
onset
of
maximum
block
following
NIMBEX
is
approximately
2
minutes
faster
with
prior
administration
of
succinylcholine
.
Prior
administration
of
succinylcholine
had
no
effect
on
the
duration
of
neuromuscular
block
following
initial
or
maintenance
bolus
doses
of
NIMBEX
.
Infusion
requirements
of
NIMBEX
in
patients
administered
succinylcholine
prior
to
infusions
of
NIMBEX
were
comparable
to
or
slightly
greater
than
when
succinylcholine
was
not
administered
.
The
use
of
NIMBEX
before
succinylcholine
to
attenuate
some
of
the
side
effects
of
succinylcholine
has
not
been
studied
.
Although
not
studied
systematically
in
clinical
trials
,
no
drug
interactions
were
observed
when
vecuronium
,
pancuronium
,
or
atracurium
were
administered
following
varying
degrees
of
recovery
from
single
doses
or
infusions
of
NIMBEX

administered
with
nitrous
oxide/oxygen
to
achieve
1.25
MAC
-LSB-
Minimum

may
prolong
the
clinically
effective
duration
of
action
of
initial
and
maintenance
doses
of
NIMBEX
and
decrease
the
required
infusion
rate
of
NIMBEX
.
The
magnitude
of
these
effects
may
depend
on
the
duration
of
administration
of
the
volatile
agents
.
Fifteen
to
30
minutes
of
exposure
to
1.25
MAC
isoflurane
or
enflurane
had
minimal
effects
on
the
duration
of
action
of
initial
doses
of
NIMBEX
and
therefore
,
no
adjustment
to
the
initial
dose
should
be
necessary
when
NIMBEX
is
administered
shortly
after
initiation
of
volatile
agents
.
In
long
surgical
procedures
during
enflurane
or
isoflurane
anesthesia
,
less
frequent
maintenance
dosing
,
lower
maintenance
doses
,
or
reduced
infusion
rates
of
NIMBEX
may
be
necessary
.
The
average
infusion
rate
requirement
may
be
decreased
by
as
much
as
30
%
to
40
%
.
In
clinical
studies
propofol
had
no
effect
on
the
duration
of

.
Other
drugs
which
may
enhance
the
neuromuscular

The
concurrent
administration
of
allopurinol
and
ampicillin
increases
substantially
the
incidence
of
rashes
in
patients
receiving
both
drugs
as
compared
to
patients
receiving
ampicillin
alone
.
It
is
not
known
whether
this
potentiation
of
ampicillin
rashes
is
due
to
allopurinol
or
the
hyperuricemia
present
in
these
patients
.
In
controlled
clinical
trials
of
AUGMENTIN

However
,
this

conclusions
to
be
drawn
regarding
the
risk
of

AUGMENTIN
XR
and
allopurinol
use
.
In
common
with

that
,
in
most
subjects

,
the
possible
benefits

do
not
outweigh
the
risks

have
occasionally
been
associated

In

,
they
may
vary
in
the

Fluvoxamine
has
also
been
shown
to
inhibit
P450

.
The
extent
to

lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
the

.
Furthermore
,
whenever

withdrawn
from
co-therapy
,
an
increased
dose
of

patients
-RRB-
,
be
accompanied
by
profound
collapse
and
respiratory
and/or
cardiac
arrest
.
Some
of
the
cases
of
collapse/respiratory
arrest/cardiac
arrest
during
initial
treatment
occurred
in
patients
who
were
being
administered
benzodiazepines
.
similar
events
have
been
reported
in
patients
taking
other
psychotropic
drugs
or
even
Clozapine
by
itself
.
Although
it
has
not
been
established
that
there
is
an
interaction
between
Clozapine
and
benzodiazepines
or
other
psychotropics
,
caution
is
advised
when
clozapine
is
initiated
in
patients
taking
a
benzodiazepine
or
any
other
psychotropic
drug
.
Clozapine
may
potentiate
the
hypotensive
effects
of
antihypertensive
drugs
and
the
anticholinergic
effects
of
atropine-type
drugs
.
The
administration
of
epinephrine
should
be
avoided
in
the
treatment
of
drug
induced
hypotension
because
of
a
possible
reverse
epinephrine
effect
.
Pharmacokinetic-related
Interactions
:
Clozapine
is
a
substrate
for
many
CYP
450
isozymes
,
in
particular
1A2
,
2D6
,
and
3A4
.
The
risk
of
metabolic
interactions
caused
by
an
effect
on
an
individual
isoform
is
therefore
minimized
.
Nevertheless
,
caution
should
be
used
in
patients
receiving
concomitant
treatment
with
other
drugs
that
are
either
inhibitors
or
inducers
of
these
enzymes
.
Concomitant
administration
of
drugs
known
to
induce
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
may
decrease
the
plasma
levels
of
clozapine
.
Phenytoin
,
nicotine
,
and
rifampin
may
decrease
Clozapine
plasma
levels
,
resulting
in
a
decrease
in
effectiveness
of
a
previously
effective
Clozapine
dose
.
Concomitant
administration
of
drugs
known
to
inhibit
the
activity
of
cytochrome
P450
isozymes
may
increase
the
plasma
levels
of
clozapine
.
Cimetidine
,
caffeine
,
and
erythromycin
may
increase
plasma
levels
of
Clozapine
,
potentially
resulting
in
adverse
effects
.
Although
concomitant
use
of
Clozapine
and
carbamazepine
is
not
recommended
,
it
should
be
noted
that
discontinuation
of
concomitant
carbamazepine
administration
may
result
in
an
increase
in
Clozapine
plasma
levels
.
In
a
study
of
schizophrenic
patients
who
received
clozapine
under
steady
state
conditions
,
fluvoxamine
or
paroxetine
was
added
in
16
and
14
patients
,
respectively
.
After
14
days
of
co-administration
,
mean
trough
concentrations
of
clozapine
and
its
metabolites
,
N-desmethylclozapine
and
clozapine
N-oxide
,
were
elevated
with
fluvoxamine
by
about
three-fold
compared
to
baseline
concentrations
.
Paroxetine
produced
only
minor
changes
in
the
levels
of
clozapine
and
its
metabolites
.
However
,
other
published
reports
describe
modest
elevations
-LRB-
less
than
two-fold
-RRB-
of
clozapine
and
metabolite
concentrations
when
clozapine
was
taken
with
paroxetine
,
fluoxetine
,
and
sertraline
.
Therefore
,
such
combined
treatment
should
be
approached
with
caution
and
patients
should
be
monitored
closely
when
Clozapine
is
combined
with
these
drugs
,
particularly
with
fluvoxamine
.
A
reduced
Clozapine
dose
should
be
considered
.
A
subset
-LRB-
3
%
-10
%
-RRB-
of
the
population
has
reduced
activity
of
certain
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
such
as
the
cytochrome
P450
isozyme
P450
2D6
.
Such
individuals
are
referred
to
as
poor
metabolizers
of
drugs
such
as
debrisoquin
,
dextromethorphan
,
the
tricyclic
antidepressants
,
and
clozapine
.
These
individuals
may
develop
higher
than
expected
plasma
concentrations
of
clozapine
when
given
usual
doses
.
In
addition
,
certain
drugs
that
are
metabolized
by
this
isozyme
,
including
many
antidepressants
-LRB-
clozapine
,
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
,
and
others
-RRB-
,
may
inhibit
the
activity
of
this
isozyme
,
and
thus
may
make
normal
metabolizers
resemble
poor
metabolizers
with
regard
to
concomitant
therapy
with
other
drugs
metabolized
by
this
enzyme
system
,
leading
to
drug
interaction
.
Concomitant
use
of
clozapine
with
other
drugs
metabolized
by
cytochrome
P450
2D6
may
require
lower
doses
than
usually
prescribed
for
either
clozapine
or
the
other
drug
.
Therefore
,
co-administration
of
clozapine
with
other
drugs
that
are
metabolized
by
this
isozyme
,
including
antidepressants
,
phenothiazines
,
carbamazepine
,
and
Type
1C
antiarrhythmics
-LRB-
e.g.
,

-RRB-
,
or
that
inhibit
this
enzyme
-LRB-
e.g.
,
quinidine
-RRB-
,
should
be
approached
with
caution
.
The
risk
of

WelChol
has
been

drug
interaction
studies
in
which
it
was
administered
with
a

WelChol
was

bioavailability
of
digoxin
,
lovastatin
,
metoprolol

by
approximately
31

Since
there
is

It
may
be
necessary
to
adjust
the
dosage
of
oral
anticoagulants
upon
beginning
or
stopping
disulfiram
.
since
disulfiram
may
prolong
prothrombin
time
.
Patients
taking
isoniazid
when
disulfiram
is
given
should
be
observed
for
the
appearance
of
unsteady
gait
or
marked
changes
in
mental
status
.
the
disulfiram
should
be
discontinued
if
such
signs
appear
.
In
rats
,
simultaneous
ingestion
of
disulfiram
and
nitrite
in
the
diet
for
78
weeks
has
been
reported
to
cause
tumors
,
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
disulfiram
may
react
with
nitrites
in
the
rat
stomach
to
form
a
nitrosamine
,
which
is
tumorigenic
.
Disulfiram
alone
in
the
rat
s
diet
did
not
lead
to
such
tumors
.
The
relevance
of
this
finding
to
humans
is
not
known
at
this

.
Animal
studies
indicate
that
dobutamine
may
be
ineffective
if
the
patient
has
recently
received
a
b-blocking
drug
.
In
such
a
case
,
the
peripheral
vascular
resistance
may
increase
.
Preliminary
studies
indicate
that
the
concomitant
use
of
dobutamine
and
nitroprusside
results
in
a
higher
cardiac
output
and
,
usually
,
a
lower
pulmonary
wedge
pressure
than
when
either
drug
is
used

.
There
was
no
evidence
of

to
evaluate
the
drug
interactions
of
TAXOTERE
with
other
medications
.
In

studies
have
shown
that
the
metabolism

be
modified
by
the

Caution
should
be
exercised
with

:
Studies
in
healthy
volunteers
have
shown
that
TIKOSYN
does
not
affect
the
pharmacokinetics
of
digoxin
.
In

administration
of
digoxin
with

It
is
not
clear
whether
this

to
examine
the
effects
of

lower
in
patients
on

respectively
.
The
potential
for
clinically
significant
drug-drug
interactions
posed
by
dolasetron
and
hydrodolasetron
appears
to
be
low
for
drugs
commonly
used
in
chemotherapy
or
surgery
,
because
hydrodolasetron
is
eliminated
by
multiple
routes
.
Blood
levels
of
hydrodolasetron
increased
24
%
when
dolasetron
was
coadministered
with
cimetidine
-LRB-
nonselective
inhibitor
of
cytochrome
P-450

.
Dolasetron
has
been
safely
coadministered
with
drugs
used
in
chemotherapy
and
surgery
.
This
observed
increase
in
the
bioavailability
of
fexofenadine
may
be
due
to
transport-related
effects
,
such
as
p-glycoprotein
.
in
vivo
animal
studies
also
suggest
that
in
addition
to
enhancing
absorption
,
ketoconazole
decreases
fexofenadine
gastrointestinal
secretion
,
while
erythromycin
may
also
decrease
biliary
excretion
.

Interactions
with
Fruit
Juices
Fruit
juices
such
as
grapefruit
,
orange
and
apple
may
reduce
the
bioavailability
and
exposure
of
fexofenadine
.
This
is
based
on
the
results
from
3
clinical
studies
using
histamine
induced
skin
wheals
and
flares
coupled
with
population
pharmacokinetic
analysis
.
The
size
of
wheal
and
flare
were
significantly
larger
when
fexofenadine
hydrochloride
was
administered
with
either
grapefruit
or
orange
juices
compared
to
water
.
Based
on
the
literature
reports
,
the
same
effects
may
be
extrapolated
to
other
fruit
juices
such
as
apple
juice
.
The
clinical
significance
of
these
observations
is
unknown
.
In

based
on
the
population

of
the
combined
data
from
grapefruit
and

juices
studies
with
the
data
from
a
bioequivalence
study
,
the
bioavailability
of
fexofenadine
was
reduced
by
36
%
.
Therefore
,
to
maximize
the
effects
of
fexofenadine
,
it
is
recommended
that

In
a

involving
healthy

and
propranolol
concurrently
,
plasma
flecainide
levels
were
increased
about
20
%
and
propranolol
levels
were
increased
about
30
%
compared
to
control
values
.
In
this
formal
interaction
study
,
TAMBOCOR
and
propranolol
were
each
found
to
have
negative
inotropic
effects
.
when
the
drugs
were
administered
together
,
the
effects
were
additive
.
The
effects
of
concomitant
administration
of
TAMBOCOR
and
propranolol
on
the
PR
interval
were
less
than
additive
.
In
TAMBOCOR
clinical
trials
,
patients
who
were
receiving
beta
blockers
concurrently
did
not
experience
an
increased
incidence
of
side
effects
.
Nevertheless
,
the
possibility
of
additive
negative
inotropic
effects
of
beta
blockers
and
flecainide
should
be
recognized
.
Flecainide
is
not
extensively
bound
to
plasma
proteins
.
In
vitro
studies
with
several
drugs
which
may
be
administered
concomitantly
showed
that
the
extent
of
flecainide
binding
to
human
plasma
proteins
is
either
unchanged
or
only
slightly
less
.
Consequently
,
interactions
with
other
drugs
which
are
highly
protein
bound
-LRB-
e.g.
,
anticoagulants
-RRB-
would
not
be
expected
.
TAMBOCOR
has
been
used
in
a
large
number
of
patients
receiving
diuretics
without
apparent
interaction
.
Limited
data
in
patients
receiving
known
enzyme
inducers
-LRB-
phenytoin
,
phenobarbital
,
carbamazepine
-RRB-
indicate
only
a
30
%
increase
in
the
rate
of
flecainide
elimination
.
In
healthy
subjects
receiving
cimetidine
-LRB-
1
gm
daily
-RRB-
for
one
week
,
plasma
flecainide
levels
increased
by
about
30
%
and
half-life
increased
by
about
10
%
.
When
amiodarone
is
added
to
flecainide
therapy
,
plasma
flecainide
levels
may
increase
two-fold
or
more
in
some
patients
,
if
flecainide
dosage
is
not
reduced
.
Drugs
that
inhibit
cytochrome
P450IID6
,
such
as
quinidine
,
might
increase
the
plasma
concentrations
of
flecainide
in
patients
that
are
on
chronic
flecainide
therapy
.
especially
if

has
been
little
experience
with
the
coadministration
of
TAMBOCOR

either
disopyramide

verapamil
.
Because
both
of
these
drugs
have
negative
inotropic
properties
and
the
effects
of
coadministration
with
TAMBOCOR
are
unknown
,
neither

unless
,
in
the
judgment
of
the
physician
,
the
benefits
of
this

Vaccines
neurological
complications
and
lack

response
.
Estrogen
increased
levels
of
corticosteroid-binding
globulin
,
thereby
increasing
the
bound
-LRB-
inactive
-RRB-
fraction
.
this
effect
is
at
least
balanced
by
decreased
metabolism
of
corticosteroids
.
When
estrogen
therapy
is
initiated
,
a
reduction
in
corticosteroid
dosage
may
be
required
,
and
increased
amounts
may
be
required
when

Drug/Laboratory
Test
Interactions
Corticosteroids
may
affect
the
nitrobluetetrazolium
test
for
bacterial
infection
and
produce
false-negative
result
.
Interaction
with
central
nervous
system
depressants
other
than
benzodiazepines
has
not
been
specifically
studied
.
however
,
no
deleterious
interactions
were
seen
when
ROMAZICON
was
administered
after
narcotics
,
inhalational
anesthetics
,
muscle
relaxants
and
muscle
relaxant
antagonists
administered
in
conjunction
with
sedation
or
anesthesia
.
Particular
caution
is
necessary
when
using
ROMAZICON
in
cases
of
mixed
drug
overdosage
since
the
toxic
effects
-LRB-
such
as
convulsions
and
cardiac
dysrhythmias
-RRB-
of
other
drugs
taken
in
overdose
-LRB-
especially
cyclic
antidepressants
-RRB-
may
emerge
with
the
reversal
of
the
benzodiazepine
effect
by
flumazenil
.
The
use
of
ROMAZICON
is
not
recommended
in
epileptic
patients
who
have
been
receiving
benzodiazepine
treatment
for
a
prolonged
period
.
Although
ROMAZICON
exerts
a
slight
intrinsic
anticonvulsant
effect
,
its
abrupt
suppression
of
the
protective
effect
of
a
benzodiazepine
agonist
can
give
rise
to
convulsions
in
epileptic
patients
.
ROMAZICON
blocks
the
central
effects
of
benzodiazepines
by
competitive
interaction
at
the
receptor
level
.
The
effects
of
nonbenzodiazepine
agonists
at
benzodiazepine
receptors
,
such
as
zopiclone
,
triazolopyridazines
and
others
,
are
also
blocked
by
ROMAZICON
.
The
pharmacokinetics
of
benzodiazepines
are
unaltered
in
the
presence
of
flumazenil
and
vice
versa
.
There
is
no
pharmacokinetic
interaction
between
ethanol
and
flumazenil
.
Use
in
Ambulatory
Patients
The
effects
of
ROMAZICON
may
wear
off
before
a
long-acting
benzodiazepine
is
completely
cleared
from
the
body
.
In
general
,
if
a
patient
shows
no
signs
of
sedation
within
2
hours
after
a
1-mg
dose
of
flumazenil
,
serious
resedation
at
a
later
time
is
unlikely
.
An
adequate
period
of
observation
must
be
provided
for
any
patient
in
whom
either
long-acting
benzodiazepines
-LRB-
such
as
diazepam
-RRB-
or
large
doses
of
short-acting
benzodiazepines
-LRB-
such
as
10
mg
of
midazolam
-RRB-
have
been
used
.
Because
of
the
increased
risk
of
adverse
reactions
in
patients
who
have
been
taking
benzodiazepines
on
a
regular
basis
,
it
is
particularly
important
that
physicians
query
patients
or
their
guardians
carefully
about
benzodiazepine
,
alcohol
and
sedative
use
as
part
of
the
history
prior
to
any
procedure
in
which
the
use
of
ROMAZICON
is
planned
